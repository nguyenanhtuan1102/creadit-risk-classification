## Introdution

This project aimed to classify clients based on their credit risk, which involved building a predictive model that could accurately identify high-risk clients. The Credit Risk Classification Project was developed as part of The Data Analytics Competition hosted by Ho Chi Minh University of Banking, where it achieved a top placement.

## Content

Key highlights of the project include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, identify trends, and detect anomalies. Visualize key features and relationships to inform subsequent modeling choices.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Transform categorical variables, scale numerical features, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- **Model Selection and Optimization**: Choose appropriate algorithms for credit risk classification, for my team is XGBoost. Fine-tune model parameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search to enhance performance.

- **Evaluation and Results**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Present results visually and interpret findings to understand the model's effectiveness in predicting credit risk.

## Result

In this project, we use XGBoost to perform customer risk classification. The results are as follows: Accuracy: 0.954, F1-Score: 0.954, AUC: 0.969

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed an XGBoost model to classify credit risk clients with high accuracy (95.4%) and AUC (0.969), earning first place in the Data Analytics Competition. Through thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization, the project demonstrated effective risk assessment, highlighting its potential impact in financial risk management.
